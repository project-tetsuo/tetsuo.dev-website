This is the full http://somegitrepo.com string. That is, the string needs to include the http:// component as well. We figured more people will simply cut and paste this value so including it would make sense.</p> <p>BRANCH - This is the branch of the code that you would like to pull.

One of the drawbacks that we see with the current approach to serverless is the need to refactor code to enable it to work with most Function-as-a-Service platforms.
